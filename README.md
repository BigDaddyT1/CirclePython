## Multi-Part Design Studios

### Description 
This assignment was to get us ready for our assesment next year. we are given very few instructions and told to build and desighn a vacume pump and answer the 4 questions that change the design of the pump as we go along.

- for this part it is given to us and we are suppost to build everything around the cylinder

- for this part we are suppost to build a top and bottom to the vacume pump and are told to build the bottom forst because we can just copy and mirrir across the middle plane. We designed a 100 * 100 square and added holes into the corner and did a semetric mate with a second end postition. we made one side 10mm and the other 48 making the whole thing 58 mm. the mirrored it across the middle of the cylinder.

- For this part we are supposed to add the actual plunger to the inside of the cylinder making it 125 mm long and adding a flat surface to the end of the plunger making it 130mm in total.

- for this part we just added on to the actuall plunger part. then we exruded and made it one big solid cylinder then drew on the top and the side of the new peice. Cut on the side and cut out one big peice at the top making the plunger peice one big peice. Then decided to add all the fillets to all the peices.

- these are the Rods. I add them at the end because it is the easiest peice making them 195 mm long almost filling the hole completlly.

- This is a finished section view of my finished product.
### Reflection
The hardest thing about this part of this project was making sure the weight was the right weight because if it was not then you would have to go through every part and make sure everything was right and that was very time cosuming. And it wa very challanging at some points making sure everything was mated and in the right places at some points but overall it was a fun project to build.


## Swing Arm 

### Description & Code
Introduction:

One of the goals of this class is to get ready to earn your Certified Onshape Associate certification. This is a timed test that requires mastery of many different CAD concepts. As Engineering 3 students we worked extensively with CAD, but may have a different level of mastery from other students. This assignment will help determine what additional concepts you need to focus on for the certification exam. 

Assignment:
we are told to create a swing arm given very few instructions and are told he first two tabs contain instructions, and the last four contain the drawings you will use to create the part. Create a new part studio and rename it swing arm. Design the part using the four drawings as a guide. Notice that three dimensions are not defined directly. These dimensions will change values, so it is a good idea to define them as variables so that you can easily change them later.
Update the model based on the dimensions and materials listed in the instructions tab of the Swing Arm.

- this is a picture of my final sketch of My swing arm peice we are given very little informatiojn and have to find the angles to find ot how long the arms are and the big and small circles are in the middle of the whole design.

### Reflection
The hardest thing about this part of this project was making sure the weight was the right weight because if it was not then you would have to go through every part and make sure everything was right and that was very time cosuming. And it wa very challanging at some points making sure everything was extruded and all the edges were fileted because without that the weight was thrown of several times and it was very time consuming figuring out whaat the problem was when it was that small. overall it was a fun project to build but also very anoying to finish.



## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work 

### Description & Code
The Assignment:
THIS Project we are challanged to make a spinner with a partner and we are both given parts A or B and i was given part a And jacob my partner was guven part b.

- this is the The finished version of the top and ring price that will ultamatlly when added with the key will make the spinner fly out of the top and start to spin we are given the ring peice and told to build to top peice over it and mate it to the key part it was very simple. we extrude and fillet the sides and then were done with the peice.

- this is a finished picture of our key we designed this whole part making the the circillar end first then adding a long rectangle and then adding the teeth with a champher which made it way easier. Ten that peice is revolve mated to the edge of the top part of the key.

- my partner made the prop while we both deighned the actuall spinner peices because we both had to add difrent types oo spinner tops to make the top difrent types of tops. and i would say desighning all the difrent types of tops was the most time consuming thing but the mos fun out of all of them.

- this is a finished deighn of the pull copter 


### Reflection
this was the hardest assignment of all because it used all of the components of our first 3 assighnments but it made it way eisier when i had a partner who could help me bring the project together when i did not know things. it made it way better and i felt like i was doing more than i could handle.
