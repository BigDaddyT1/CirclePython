This repository will actually serve as a aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code

    print (r,g,b)
    dot.fill((r,g,b))
    time.sleep (0.05)

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
The hardest thing about this part of this project was the code part and getting the color to change at diffret distances in the project. And the fact that i kept having to go in and change things constantly when it was just a simple camma made my life way harder than it had to be. Overall now i undrstand what ground is and how it works with making things work.

### Description & Code
Use the HC-SR04 to measure the distance to an object and print that out to your serial monitor or LCD in cm.
Next, you will get the neopixel to turn red when your object is less than 5cm, blue when between 5 and 20cm, and green when farther than 20cm.
For your final version of this code, you'll smoothly shift the color of the onboard neopixel, corresponding to the distance, according to the graphic below.
(Neopixel should stay red when below 5cm and green when above 35cm)
Here's how you make code look like code:

```python

##DistanceSensor 
##this code will madke the LED change colors depending on the distance from the sensor

import board
import time 
import neopixel
import adafruit_hcsr04
import simpleio
sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D5, echo_pin=board.D6)
dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5

while True:

    try:
        distance = sonar.distance
        (print (distance))
    except RuntimeError:
        print("Retrying!") 
        time.sleep(0.1)

    if distance < 5: ## if distance is less than 5cm then the light will turn red
        r = 255
        g = 0 
        b = 0 
        print("<5")
    elif distance < 25 and distance > 20: ## if the distance is greater than 5cm and less than 20cm the led goes from red to blue  
        r = int(simpleio.map_range(distance, 5, 20, 255, 0))
        g = int(0)
        b = int(simpleio.map_range(distance, 5, 20, 0, 255))
        print(">5<20")
    elif distance < 20 and distance > 35: ## if the distance is greater than 20cm and less than 30cm the led goes from blue to green 
        r = int(0)
        g = int(simpleio.map_range(distance, 20, 35, 0, 255))
        b = int(simpleio.map_range(distance, 20, 35, 255, 0))
        print(">20<35")
    elif distance > 35: ## if the distance is greater than 35cm the led is green 
        r = 0 
        g = 255
        b = 0
        print(">35")
